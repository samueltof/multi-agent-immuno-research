# Scientific Evaluation Framework for Web-Based Research Agents

## Abstract

This document presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing the performance of web-based research agents using rigorous scientific methodologies. Our framework employs LLM-as-a-judge evaluation techniques with 12 distinct metrics across 8 domains, utilizing a dataset of 57 carefully curated test cases designed to meet academic research standards.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Research Problem
The evaluation of AI-powered research agents presents unique challenges due to the subjective nature of research quality and the complexity of web-based information retrieval and synthesis. Traditional metrics fail to capture the nuanced aspects of research effectiveness, source credibility assessment, and information synthesis quality.

### 1.2 Contribution
We present a novel evaluation framework that:
- Employs 12 multi-dimensional evaluation metrics based on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) best practices
- Utilizes a scientifically rigorous test dataset with 57 cases across 8 domains
- Implements adversarial testing for bias detection and misinformation handling
- Provides comprehensive coverage of research scenarios from basic to expert level
